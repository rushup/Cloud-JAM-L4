# Cloud-JAM L4

Cloud-JAM L4 is the product accelerator (production grade solution) of ST functional pack P-NUCLEO-AZURE1 that combines:

-  NUCLEO L476RG
-  NUCLEO SHIELD IKS01A2
-  NUCLEO SHIELD NFC01A1
-  NUCLEO SHIELD IDW01M1

At a firmware level the Cloud-Jam works the same way as those 4 hardware combined.

So any project or binary created for STM32L476RG microcontroller can run or be debugged on the Cloud- JAM.
